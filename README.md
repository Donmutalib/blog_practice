# blog_practice
This is the second blog that I have created. It is a basic project that I created to improve my understanding of class based views. 
This blog can perform Create Read Update and Delete operations on posts and handles authentication and user permissionss.
It is a Docker based app deployed on Railway with a Postgres database
