# blog_practice
This is the second blog that I have created. It is a basic project that I created to improve my understanding of class based views. 
This blog can perform basic Create Read Update and Delete operations. 
This blog handles authentication and user permissionss and can perform basic tasks like registering users and logging users in and out.
It is a Docker based app and was deployed on Heroku. 
For the database, I created a Postgres database with Amazon RDS.
